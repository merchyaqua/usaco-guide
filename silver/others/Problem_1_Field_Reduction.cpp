    /* KEY: there are 4 possible boundary points for each side of the rectangle: 
    You can remove 3, 2, 1 or 0 points from each side.
    E.g. top edge, removing 3 highest points leaves you with the 4th highest point on the boundary (to squeeze out the area to minimum)
    Removing 0 points leaves you with the highest point as boundary.
    Similarly, in between, removing 2 -> 3rd highest on boundary etc.

    We don't worry about removing too many points - our area function deals with it.
    However, if you dictate the number of points removed here
    ...you wouldn't be able to manually tell if you've removed 1 or more points on the same line
    so this is a nice catch-all. */

    /* My initial idea was to go through every point and calculate its distance from every other point to determin the outlier, but that would be n^2 -> 2.5*10^9.
    This method gives 4*4*4*4 (sets of 4 edges to check) * n (points to check for each set). Worst case this would be 4^4 * 50000 = 1.28*10^7 operations. 
    Usually, under 10^8 is acceptable. USACO grader can do 10^8 per second. Time limit is 2s.
